# Dashboard Overview: My Garmin Activities Insights
### Purpose and Objective
Since 2019, I have lost 40 pounds, and during that time, I have religiously worn a Garmin watch. This project aims to analyze the activities and trends that have contributed to my fitness achievements over the years, identifying what has worked best to reach this fitness level.

### Dashboard 1: Yearly and Monthly Activity Overview (2019 - 2024)
This dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of my Garmin-tracked activities from 2019 to 2024. It is divided into two main sections:

**Yearly Activity Summary**

Total Time in Activities: This section visualizes the cumulative time spent on all activities for each year using a stacked bar chart. The bars are segmented by activity type, offering insights into how my focus on different activities has evolved over the years.
Monthly Activity Breakdown

Monthly Distribution: This area breaks down the selected activities on a monthly basis within each year. Users can pivot between different years and activity types using the filter section to gain detailed monthly insights, ideal for understanding seasonal trends and variations in activity levels.

**Navigation and Interactivity**

Navigation Button: Positioned in the upper right-hand corner, this button directs users to the second dashboard, enabling seamless transitions between different levels of data granularity.

### Dashboard 2: Weekly Activity Insights
This dashboard delves into a more granular analysis, focusing on weekly trends within the selected year:

**Weekly Activity Overview**

This section offers a breakdown of activities by week, providing insights into consistency and intensity on a week-to-week basis. The stacked bar charts illustrate how different activity types contribute to the total time spent each week.

**Filtering Options**

Similar to the first dashboard, users can filter by year and activity type, enabling a focused view of specific activities over time.

### Design Choices
My goal was to create a dashboard that is both simple and user-friendly. The color scheme reflects this simplicity, with minimal colors used to keep the focus clear while boldly highlighting areas for user interactivity, such as navigation and filters. The first dashboard provides an overview of how my activities have evolved throughout my journey, while the second dashboard allows users to drill down into weekly trends for deeper insights.

### Challenges and Solutions
Several fields required transformation to be effectively used in the visualizations. For example, "Total Ascent" and "Total Descent" needed to be converted from strings to numbers. Additionally, "Total Time" required a custom calculation to convert it from a date/time format to a duration format for accurate analysis.

### Potential Use Cases
This dashboard offers valuable insights into general fitness trends, performance over the years, and highlights which activities have been most consistent throughout my weight loss journey. These insights are crucial for maintaining long-term consistency in a fitness routine.

### Future Enhancements
Currently, this data is limited to activities recorded with my Garmin watch. Integrating additional data such as sleep patterns and steps not recorded during activities would provide a more comprehensive view of my overall health and fitness trends.

### Final Thoughts
This dashboard serves as a powerful tool not only for tracking and visualizing my fitness journey but also for identifying the key factors that have driven my success. By focusing on user-friendly design and meaningful insights, this project showcases my ability to transform raw data into actionable intelligence. The challenges I encountered, such as data transformation and visualization, demonstrate my problem-solving skills and technical proficiency in Tableau. As I continue to enhance this dashboard with additional data sources and features, it will evolve into an even more robust tool for monitoring and optimizing health and fitness, providing valuable lessons for anyone on a similar journey. This project highlights my capability to deliver impactful, data-driven solutions that can be applied to various aspects of personal and professional growth.
