## 2023: A Shift in Focus

- **Increase in Cardio**: While overall activity time decreased from 22,167 minutes in 2022 to 18,224 minutes in 2023, there was a notable shift in focus towards cardio sessions. This reflects a transition in my fitness goals, emphasizing strength training while maintaining a reasonable level of mountain biking.

- **Tracking Adjustments**:
  - Unlike in 2022, I didn’t track every single activity. After completing the 75 Hard Challenge, I became more intuitive with my body’s needs and didn’t feel the need to track certain activities, such as walking and yoga, as meticulously.
  - Hiking saw a 1,000-minute increase, aligning with my goal to hike more in 2023.

## 2024: Continuing the Trend

- **Cardio as a Priority**: As of August 2024, cardio sessions have become an integral part of my daily routine, with over 5,100 minutes tracked so far. This puts me on pace to exceed the previous year's time spent on cardio.

- **Mountain Biking and Hiking**:
  - Both activities are on track to match or exceed last year’s time spent.
  - The increased average heart rate during mountain biking (rising from ~125 to ~140) reflects the more challenging terrain in my new location, requiring higher intensity rides.

- **Changes in Walking**:
  - My goal has shifted from tracking walking time to focusing on daily steps (7,000 to 8,000 per day), which has led to a decrease in tracked walking activities.

- **Summer Challenges**:
  - The summer months in Phoenix have posed challenges, leading to a decrease in weekly distance, calories burned, and total ascent due to the extreme heat and reduced riding opportunities.

## 2024 compared to 2022

Focusing on the fitness focus of 2022 and the new challenging terrain for mountain biking in 2024, there are a few comparison to make. 
- **The scatterplot** below identifies average heart rate and average maximum heart rate show how cardiovascular performance has evolved. The change in size indicates the calories burned in mountain biking. Using 2022 as the reference point, 2023 shows less calories burned but heart rate responses indicate an improved cardiovascular level while 2024 clearly shows a significant increase in intensity of mountain bike rides in this new location. 
<img width="614" alt="Screenshot 2024-08-20 at 2 35 12 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3f895824-5211-4482-8027-d5c340a35ace">

- **Ascent per Minute:** This value indicates how many feet (or meters) of elevation gain you achieve for every minute of activity. A higher value means you’re gaining elevation faster relative to the time spent. The graph below indicates that while 2022 saw the best Ascent per min and the highest elevation gain to this point, 2024 indicates a more challenging riding environment with a significant increase in elevation gain and the lowest Ascent per min. This speaks to the new riding terrain and the elevation at which I am riding now.

- **Correlation - Avg HR vs. Calories in Mountain Biking:**
  
  - In 2020 (0.7200), there was a strong positive correlation between average heart rate and calories burned. This means that as heart rate increased, the calories burned also tended to increase significantly. This suggests that physical activities in 2020 were closely linked to intensity; higher heart rates were strongly associated with higher calorie expenditure.

  - In 2021 (0.7158), The correlation in 2021 is almost as strong as in 2020. This consistency indicates that the relationship between heart rate and calorie burn remained stable. Mountain Biking in 2021 likely mirrored the intensity patterns of the previous year, with high-intensity workouts leading to significant calorie burns.

  - In 2022 (0.4440), the correlation between average heart rate and calories burned decreased noticeably. While there's still a positive relationship, it's weaker than in the previous two years. This could indicate that my workouts or activities in 2022 varied more in terms of intensity or that other factors, such as duration or type of activity, played a more significant role in calorie expenditure than just heart rate.

  - In 2023 (0.5881), the correlation increased again compared to 2022, but it still didn't reach the levels of 2020 and 2021. This suggests that while heart rate and calorie burn were more related than in 2022, the relationship wasn't as strong as in the earlier years. This could reflect a more balanced or varied workout regimen where other factors contributed to calorie burn.

  - In 2024 (0.2172), the correlation between average heart rate and calories burned had weakened significantly. While this is only a partial picture of the year, a correlation of 0.2172 suggests that there’s only a slight positive relationship between these metrics. This could indicate that my activities have become more varied or that I am engaging in exercises where heart rate is not the primary driver of calorie expenditure (e.g., different types of training like my increased strength training (marked as cardio in activities) where calorie burn might not directly correlate with heart rate).


- **Overall Correlation Interpretation**

  - The trend shows a strong correlation between heart rate and calorie burn in the earlier years (2020 and 2021), which gradually weakens over time, especially in 2024. This weakening correlation might suggest that my fitness regimen has evolved to include a more diverse range of activities where heart rate alone is not the primary determinant of calorie burn.

  - In the earlier years, my workout intensity (reflected in heart rate) was likely a key factor in calorie expenditure. As time progressed, other factors (like the type of exercise, duration, or efficiency in calorie burn due to improved fitness) might have started playing a more significant role.

  - This shift could reflect a more nuanced understanding of fitness and calorie management, where I am incorporating various workout styles that contribute to overall health and calorie burn, but not necessarily through high heart rate alone.

- **Implications for Training**

  - As my focus has shifted from purely burning calories to improving overall fitness and strength, the decreased correlation might reflect a balanced and varied approach to my training, which can be beneficial in the long term. This makes sense when considering the lower intensity activities (untracked) I have increased over the years.

## Overall Reflections

- **2022**: Marked by dedication and rigorous tracking, 2022 saw the most significant increase in total activity time, with a clear focus on a wide variety of activities. The year’s highlight was the mountain biking trip, which had a lasting impact on my fitness journey.

- **2023**: This year represented a shift in priorities. While total tracked time decreased, the focus on cardio and selective tracking showed a maturation in how I approach my fitness goals, emphasizing quality over quantity.

- **2024**: The current year is continuing the trend from 2023, with a strong focus on cardio and maintaining consistency in mountain biking and hiking. Adjustments in tracking reflect a more personalized approach to my fitness journey.

## Conclusion

Over the years, my approach to fitness has evolved from tracking everything to focusing on what matters most. I’ve identified activities that no longer need to be meticulously tracked, as my goals and metrics have shifted. As a result, I’m now at my strongest and leanest, with a clear understanding of which activities and goals are most beneficial for my body. This shift in focus is highlighted in the correlation matrix showcasing that my focus has shifted from purely burning calories to improving overall fitness and strength the decreased correlation might reflect a balanced and varied approach to my training. 

# Other Considerations

### Design Choices
My goal was to create a dashboard that is both simple and user-friendly. The color scheme reflects this simplicity, with minimal colors used to keep the focus clear while boldly highlighting areas for user interactivity, such as navigation and filters. The first dashboard provides an overview of how my activities have evolved throughout my journey, while the second dashboard allows users to drill down into weekly trends for deeper insights.

### Challenges and Solutions
Several fields required transformation to be effectively used in the visualizations. For example, "Total Ascent" and "Total Descent" needed to be converted from strings to numbers. Additionally, "Total Time" required a custom calculation to convert it from a date/time format to a duration format for accurate analysis. Ascent per min was calculated to determine whether I am climbing during mountain biking more efficiently (e.g., gaining more elevation in less time) or if there are areas where performance has declined. A correlation was calculated using the Pearson correlation coefficient for insights into Avg Heart Rate vs. Calories into how my fitness regimen has evolved over time. 

### Potential Use Cases
This dashboard offers valuable insights into general fitness trends, performance over the years, and highlights which activities have been most consistent or meaningful for my fitness throughout my weight loss journey. These insights are crucial for maintaining long-term consistency in a fitness routine.

### Future Enhancements
Currently, this data is limited to activities recorded with my Garmin watch. Integrating additional data such as weekly weight change, sleep patterns, steps not recorded during activities, nutrition insights, and heart rate variability would provide a more comprehensive view of my overall health and fitness trends.

### Final Thoughts
This dashboard serves as a powerful tool not only for tracking and visualizing my fitness journey but also for identifying the key factors that have driven my success. By focusing on user-friendly design and meaningful insights, this project showcases my ability to transform raw data into actionable intelligence. The challenges I encountered, such as data transformation and visualization, demonstrate my problem-solving skills and technical proficiency in Tableau. As I continue to enhance this dashboard with additional data sources and features, it will evolve into an even more robust tool for monitoring and optimizing health and fitness, providing valuable lessons for anyone on a similar journey. This project highlights my capability to deliver impactful, data-driven solutions that can be applied to various aspects of personal and professional growth.
